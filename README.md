# Stat437-Project
We intend to utilize data gathered on cerebral stroke to analyze the effects of a patient's lifestyle, health history, and other factors on whether they suffered a stroke.  We are specifically interested in work type.  Our question is, "Does self employment impact a patient's risk of suffering a stroke?"
